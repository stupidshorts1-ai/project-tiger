      Habitat of The Royal Bengal Tiger
    </h1>
    <p>
      The famous Royal Bengal Tiger is currently distributed along India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and China. Although its historical range used to spam from Myanmar in the East to the Indus Basin (modern day Pakistan) in the West, it has since gone extinct in those areas and remains present only in the above mentioned areas currently.
