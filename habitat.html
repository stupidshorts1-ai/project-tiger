      Habitat of The Royal Bengal Tiger
    </h1>
    <p>
      The famous Royal Bengal Tiger is currently distributed along India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and China. Although its historical range used to spam from Myanmar in the East to the Indus Basin <br>(modern day Pakistan) in the West, it has since gone extinct in those areas and remains present only in the above mentioned areas currently.    </p>

	<h2>
	  India
	</h2>
	<p>
		India is the country with the highest population of Bengal Tigers, with an estimated population of about 3500. Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal are some of<br> the states with the highest tiger population in India. Some famous spots where the Bengal Tiger resides are :</h3>
	</p>
	  <ul>

		  <li><h3>Central Indian Highlands</h3> There is about 550 tigers in this area, most notably in Ranthambore National Park, Rajasthan; Kuno National Park, Gwalior and Bandhavgarh National Park, Umaria.</li>

	  </ul>
	<h2>
		Bangladesh
	</h2>
	  <p>
		  In Bangladesh, a large number of Bengal Tigers usually reside in the Indian adjacent Sunderbans Mangrove Delta, with a small amount in the Myanmar-India adjacent Chittagong Hill Tracts. These 114 Bangladeshi tigers are threatened by rising sea levels, habitat loss and poaching, with the Bangladeshi Bengal Tiger population predicted to go extinct by 2070.
	  </p>
	<h2>
		Nepal
	</h2>
	  <p>
		  The tiger population of Nepal is only found in the Terai region. This population is largely split into the three isolated subpopulations, being Chitwan-Parsa National Park, Bardiya National Park and the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve. Although the tiger population was declining, recent efforts increased it to around 350 tigers. 
	  </p>
	<h2>
		Bhutan
	</h2>
	  <p>
		  Bengal Tigers in Bhutan usually inhabit the subtropical Himalayan foothills in the south of the country. The major tiger population of about 131 is mainly in the Royal Manas and Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Parks.
	  </p>
	<h2>
		China (Tibet)
	</h2>
	  <p>
		  The Chinese population of Bengal Tigers is virtually extinct, with just a population of 1-10 tigers constantly circling South Tibet and Arunachal Pradesh/Bhutan, with the sightings mainly in the Tibet border province of Mêdog.
