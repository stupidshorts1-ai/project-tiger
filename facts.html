      Facts About the Royal Bengal Tiger
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The Royal Bengal Tiger is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.</li>
	  <li>The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings.</li>
      <li>The Bengal Tiger serves as a vital role of ancient Indian mythology, appearing on the coins of the South Indian dynasties Cholas, Cheras and the Pandyas. It also appears on the Indus-Valley<br> era divine seal of Shri Pashupatinath, none other than the incarnation of Lord Shiva himself.</li>
