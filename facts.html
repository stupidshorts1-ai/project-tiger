	  <li> The Bengal Tiger's main diet consists of gaur, sambar, chital, barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, serow, takin, wild boar, hog deer, muntjac and the northern plains gray langur. Although,<br> there are rare cases where the tiger has hunted Indian leopards, mugger crocodiles, Asian black bears, sloth bears, and dhole.

	  <li> Due to an utter faliure by the Indian, Bangladeshi, and Nepali governments, poaching of the Bengal Tiger thrives in these areas, leading to the Bengal Tiger being classified as "endangered". However, conservation efforts in these countries over the last 50 years have led to small increases in population. </li>
      <li>The Bengal Tiger serves as a vital role of ancient Indian mythology, appearing on the coins of the South Indian dynasties Cholas, Cheras and the Pandyas. It also appears on the Indus-Valley<br> era divine seal of Shri Pashupatinath, none other than the incarnation of Lord Shiva himself.</li>

      <li>One of the most famous Bengal Tiger is the<strong> "Demon of Champawat" </strong> (1895-1907), a female tigress living in modern-day Uttarakhand and Nepal which killed 436 people. It was shot and killed<br> by the infamed Jim Corbett, which eventually led to his rise to fame.</li>
